/**
 * Read-model returned by {@link com.bytechef.automation.datasync.facade.DataSyncFacade} — the {@link DataSync} row plus
 * its {@link DataSyncElement} rows, and derived fields describing the draft &harr; published relationship of the Data
 * Sync's generated workflow within its project.
 *
 * @param dataSync             the Data Sync row
 * @param projectId            the project owning the Data Sync's generated workflow
 * @param elements             the Data Sync's SOURCE/DESTINATION/PROCESSOR rows
 * @param unpublishedChanges   {@code true} when the Data Sync's workflow is absent from the project's most recently
 *                             published version, or differs from it in the current draft
 * @param lastPublishedVersion the project's most recently published version number, or {@code 0} if that version does
 *                             not contain the Data Sync's workflow
 * @param publishedDate        when that published version was published, or {@code null} if it does not contain the
 *                             Data Sync's workflow
 * @param lastModifiedDate     when the Data Sync's draft workflow was last regenerated, falling back to the
 *                             {@code data_sync} row's own date
 * @param visibility           who may see the Data Sync, read from its project rather than stored on {@code data_sync}
 * @param draftWorkflowId      the id of the Data Sync's workflow in the project's current draft version
