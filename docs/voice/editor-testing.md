# Testing voice workflows in the editor

The workflow editor's test panel switches to a voice layout when the open workflow's trigger is a
`browser/v1/voiceSession` with a configured Voice Agent. Use it to iterate on prompts, models, and
tools without publishing the workflow.

## When the mic appears

The test panel checks two things on the workflow's trigger:

- Its type is `browser/v1/voiceSession`.
- Its **Voice Agent** slot (the cluster element beside Tools on the trigger) has an element
  configured.

Both true → the panel renders the voice layout and you can start a session. The trigger exists but
the Voice Agent slot is empty → the panel renders the hint "Add a Voice Agent to the trigger to test
with voice" instead of a session start control. No voice trigger at all → the panel renders the
ordinary text chat thread.

Saving the trigger's configuration is enough — deploying or publishing the workflow is not required.
The test path reads the workflow's **draft** definition directly.

## How testing differs from production voice

The editor's test path is a separate endpoint from the deployed trigger:

```
production:   wss://host/api/automation/webhooks/{webhookId}/wss?sessionToken=…
editor test:  wss://host/api/platform/internal/workflow-tests/{workflowId}/wss?sessionToken=…&environmentId=…
```

Both terminate in the same handler, but the editor path works in an environment the production path
doesn't need — connections for the trigger's Voice Agent (and any Tools) are resolved from the
workflow's **test configuration** for that environment, not from a deployment's connection
bindings. The session token is minted from
`POST /api/platform/internal/workflow-tests/{workflowId}/voice-session-token?environmentId=…`,
which requires permission to edit the workflow in that environment, and the token is bound to it:
the session runs in the environment the token was minted for. An embedded user confined to one
environment always gets a token for their own environment, whatever the request names, and an
`environmentId` on the socket upgrade itself is ignored.

One functional difference matters for iteration: **the editor test path never resumes a dropped
session.** Production sessions reconnect automatically within a 30-second window after an
unexpected close; every editor test session ends for good the moment its socket closes, and
starting the mic again always begins a brand-new session under a fresh id. This is deliberate —
you don't want a stale test connection quietly resurrected while you're mid-edit. Test sessions do honour the same session limit as
deployed ones: the trigger's `sessionLimitSeconds`, or the server's 30-minute maximum when it is `0`.

## Click flow

1. Open the test panel. If the trigger's Voice Agent slot is configured, you'll see the voice
   layout with a start control.
2. Start the session and grant microphone permission when the browser prompts. If you've denied it
   before, re-grant it through the browser's site settings.
3. The status line tracks the session: connecting, then listening or speaking once the provider
   responds.
4. While a tool call is in flight, the status line shows `Looking that up… (<tool name>)`.
5. If the connection drops mid-test, the status line would show `Reconnecting…` on a normal
   deployed session — but since the editor test path never resumes, a dropped socket here simply
   ends the run.
6. When the session ends, the status line shows `Ended: <reason>` with underscores replaced by
   spaces (for example `Ended: client closed`, `Ended: session limit`, or `Ended: silence timeout`) —
   not the raw `endReason` value.

## Iteration loop

1. Edit the Voice Agent element's prompt, greeting, or model.
2. Save the workflow.
3. Start the session, speak, listen to the response.
4. Repeat.

Each session is independent — there's no cross-session memory beyond what the provider itself keeps
in-call, and there's no continuation job during iteration (that only fires when a session hosted by
the *deployed* trigger ends). To see the continuation job's behavior — the transcript and tool calls
reaching your workflow's later tasks — publish the workflow and test through the deployed webhook
instead (see the [quickstart](./quickstart.md)).

## Browser requirements

Same as production voice: Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, or Safari 14.1+, all of which support the
`AudioWorklet` API the capture path needs.

## Troubleshooting

### No voice layout, just the text chat panel

The open workflow's trigger isn't `browser/v1/voiceSession`. Check the trigger's type.

### "Add a Voice Agent to the trigger to test with voice"

The trigger is a voice session trigger, but its Voice Agent slot is empty. Click the slot on the
trigger's cluster box, pick a provider (Deepgram, OpenAI, or ElevenLabs), and configure it — see the
[quickstart](./quickstart.md#step-2--add-the-trigger-and-pick-a-voice-agent).

### Session starts but ends immediately with a provider error

Check the connection selected on the Voice Agent element — an invalid or expired API key surfaces as
a single `error` event, then the session closes with `endReason: provider_error`. On a deployed
workflow that start failure still runs the post-call workflow, with an empty transcript; a disabled
workflow or a trigger with no Voice Agent is refused instead, and nothing runs.

### No audio in either direction

Check the browser's developer console and network tab for the WS connection. If the socket opens but
no `connected` event follows, the trigger's Voice Agent element failed to start — check the server
log for "The voice session trigger has no Voice Agent" (an empty slot) or a provider-specific
connection error.

### Testing an ElevenLabs agent and tools never fire

Client tool names on the ElevenLabs agent must exactly match your ByteChef Tools element names.
ByteChef logs a warning at session start for every ByteChef tool the ElevenLabs agent has no
matching client tool for.

### Session ends sooner than expected

Check the trigger's **Silence timeout (seconds)** property — only inbound caller audio resets it, so
a long stretch of the assistant talking without the caller responding can still trigger it; `0`
disables the silence timeout entirely. Check **Session limit (seconds)** too — its `0` behaves
differently: it doesn't disable the limit, it falls back to the server's configured maximum session
duration instead.
